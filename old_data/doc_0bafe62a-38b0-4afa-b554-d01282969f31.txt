For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth in this Section 6.21 will survive any Change of Control and will continue to apply to Parent and its Subsidiaries notwithstanding such Change of Control. g The Parties acknowledge and agree that their respective undertakings set forth in this Section 6.21 are entirely independent restrictions and are no greater than is reasonably necessary to protect the interests of Buyer and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions 77 contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements. Without limiting Section 10.3, if the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this Section 6.21 is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that i such court making such determination of invalidity or unenforceability will have the power to reduce the scope, duration or area of such term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases andor to replace any such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of such invalid or unenforceable term or provision and ii this Agreement will be valid and enforceable as so modified after the expiration of the time within which such judgment may be appealed.
