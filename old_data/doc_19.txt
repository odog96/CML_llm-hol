128 When cryptocurrency advocates say that the blockchain replaces trust, what they really mean is that making a transaction on the blockchain in volves shifting the trust that would otherwise repose in a specific trusted in termediary, like a bank, and instead placing that trust in the underlying blockchain system. The parties to such a transaction thus trust the block chain to do the things that a bank would do in a more conventional transac tion to facilitate the transfer, to ensure sender authenticity, and to vouch for the validity of the currency exchanged. The blockchain purports to do this via cryptography which validates sender authenticity and a consensus mechanism which provides a probabilistic guarantee that transactions are valid.129 As one blockchain expert stated when we transact with one anoth er on the blockchain, we are anchoring our trust in the miners. . . .130 Be cause the blockchain assumes the nodes act independently and do not trust each other, each node demands proof that a transaction occurred. The theory is that whatever emerges from that decentralized, multidirectional proof demand can be trusted to be true.131 Despite the extravagant rhetoric about trustless interactions, multiple layers of trust are built into cryptocurrencies.132 With regard to the block chain itself, users are 1 trusting developers to build secure software,133 2 trusting miners not to collude or attack the blockchain,134 and 3 trusting the wider cryptocurrency governance process not to approve a malicious hard fork.135 With regard to using the currency, users are trusting 1 that markets 128.

The biggest differences with more conven tional markets are that most of this trust is unspoken, and often unrealized by participants, and there is virtually no legal backstop should one or more of these trusts be broken.
