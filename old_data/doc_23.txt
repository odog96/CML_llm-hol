So long as a transaction is included in a block and that block is incorporated into a chain that is subse quently built upon, SPV wallets will accept the transactions as valid without checking further.154 That means that a light wallet does not actually verify that the transaction was included in the correct chainthe one that is the sin gle, agreedupon history of all transactions.155 Instead, the light nodes and hence its user trust one or more full nodes to verify transactions for them.156 SPV wallets are thus potentially at the mercy of rogue nodes, or even sloppy ones. Indeed, in July 2015, after a Bitcoin system upgrade, this vul nerability resulted in a crisis.157 Despite a consensus to upgrade to a new process, roughly half the network was mining using the old protocol, which meant they were not fully vetting blocks.158 Some of these miners produced invalid blocks that were accepted by SPV and old versions of the network software, while being rejected by the updated portion of the network. The invalid blocks showed transaction confirmations that were not real. There were at least three forks, one of which added six blocks before the valid chain reasserted itself. 159 SPV wallets were advised to wait for an additional 153. See Bisade Asolo, Full Node and Lighweight Node, MYCRYPTOPEDIA Nov. 1, 2018, httpswww.mycryptopedia.comfullnodelightweightnode. For a good description of the difference between light nodes and full nodes, see for example, AdminFrog, What Are Full Nodes and Light Nodes of the Bitcoin BlockChain, COIN FROG Jan. 14, 2018, httpscoinfrog.iofullnodeslightnodes. 154. Many assert that SPV nodes are just as secure as full nodes. See, e.g., Jonald Fyookball, Why Every Bitcoin User Should Understand SPV Security, MEDIUM May 28, 2017, httpsmedium.comjonaldfyookballwhyeverybitcoinusershouldunderstandspv security520d1d45e0b9. 155. See infra p. 24, 2627, 2933. For an explanation of how a chain can be forked into two branches and then pruned, see Eyal Sirer, supra note 87 describing selfish mining. Transactions included in a pruned block are ignored, but can be resubmitted for processing. In the interim however, the possibility of doublespending arises. 156.
