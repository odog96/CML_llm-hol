Enter Cryptocurrency What happens when the ledger keepers of fiat currency can no longer be trusted? Supporters see cryptocurrency as the answer. They claim that the immutability and irreversibility of cryptocurrency transactions offers protec tion from data breaches,79 and from untoward government meddling. The key to understanding this claim is the distributed virtual ledger called the blockchain. Every cryptocurrency transaction is encrypted and recorded in the blockchain, and anyone can see that ledger. 80 Computers serve as a series interconnected nodes that maintain and verify the block chain consensus record of transactions. The blockchain thus provides a pub licly accessible system for participants to agree on a single history of trans actions.81 Because all full nodes in the network have a record of the complete blockchain, they all have access to a shared, single source of truth.82 The nodes can work together but do not need to trust each other. For cryptocurrencys most ardent supporters, the notion that code is law,83 along with the purported immutability of the blockchain, replaces the need for trust. The blockchain grows from the interaction between users, miners and nodes. Users contribute transactions by broadcasting them to nodes. To cre ate a block to add to the Bitcoin blockchain, miners compete to solve a cryptographic puzzle, called a proof of work, in order to collect a reward in bitcoins.84 The proof of work involves encrypting new transaction requests, 77.
