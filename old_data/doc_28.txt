28 Michigan Technology Law Review Vol. 251 er, recent research shows how such an attack could be successful even with out controlling 51 of the network.189 The lesson from this should be that rhetoric about the trustless block chain may have been overblown. From the earliest inception of cryptocur rency, it has been clear that the validity of the blockchain depends on there being sufficient honest miners to validate each block. If enough miners cease or reduce their operations, the blockchain becomes vulnerable. For a finite system, this dependence on miners poses a potential problem. Rough ly 80 of the Bitcoin that will ever exist have already been mined.190 Cur rent estimates are that the last Bitcoin will be mined in 2140.191 What will happen at that date adds uncertainty to Bitcoin.192 Miners will still be needed to secure the integrity of the blockchain but will no longer obtain prizes for mining blocks. The system assumes trusts? that miners will continue to maintain the system to collect transaction fees.193 Yet, once all the Bitcoin are mined, there will be no block reward. Thus mining will be less lucrative. This is also true on a smaller scale every time the value of Bitcoin falls. Since miners are paid in the cryptocurrency, any lowering of Bitcoins value makes mining less lucrative, decreasing the incentive to mine. At some point this potentially becomes a death spiral, where the economic incentive for mining is not adequate to keep a sufficiently dispersed mining pool in place.194 Finally, it is worth noting that in contrast with cryptocurrency software developers, who tend to be wellknown and trusted that word again public figures, miners are an obscure group of anonymous people organized into a handful of pools.195 Participants place a great deal of trust in nameless, faceless miners, and in the bitcoin incentive system that purports to align miner interests with those engaged in bitcoin transactions. Most cryptocur rency participants do not realize they are trusting miners in this fashion. In stead, they probably accept the oftrepeated assertions that the blockchain 189.
