In 2014, one mining pool, Ghash.io controlled around 50 of mining on the bitcoin blockchain.175 In a statement that sounded perilously like you can trust us, the CIO of the company hastened to assure the bitcoin community that we would never harm the community.176 At the time of this writing, four mining pools, BTC.com, Antpool, BTC.Top, and Via.BTC together control roughly 70 of the bitcoin mining network.177 BTC.com, which alone controls 25 of the network,178 and Antpool, which controls 16 are both projects of the same Chinabased company, Bitman.179 Bitmans founder Jihan Wu was a significant force behind the hard fork that created Bitcoin Cash.180 The possibility that these nodes could collude to launch a 51 attack certainly exists. Overall, Chinese mining pools dominate bitcoin mining, controlling up to 80 of the network.181 For a system that depends on decentralization for validity, that seems remarkably centralized.182 However, even putting aside the prospect of a 51 attack, there are multiple, profitable ways for miners to game the verification system and un dermine the validity of the chain.

These attacks are not merely hypothetical.
