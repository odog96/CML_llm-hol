Fall 2018 Myth of the Trustless Transaction 7 United States Treasury or at any Federal Reserve Bank.39 On June 5, 1933, President Roosevelt signed House Joint Resolution 192, the socalled Gold Repeal Resolution into law.40 This Joint Resolution declared that obliga tions purporting to give the right to require payment in gold were against public policy.41 The Resolution then went on to announce that any such debts would now be payable in any coin or currency which at the time is legal tender for public and private debts.42 By fiat, the United States changed the terms by which currency issued by the United States was held.43 To be considered money, a currency must fulfill three roles it must serve as a store for value, be a unit of account, and function as a medium of exchange. Despite the changes wrought by the Gold Repeal Resolution, United States currency still fulfilled all three criteria. Comparing the fiat money, printed by the United States government, with Monopoly money, printed by the Parker Brothers44, can help clarify how fiat money works. While the United States 100 bill is fancier than the Monopoly 100 bill and has Benjamin Franklin on its front, the real difference has to do with its relationship to the government. You can pay your bills with the Benja min Franklin 100 and not the Monopoly money because the United States government has, by fiat, declared its money to be legal tender for all debts, public and private.45 One of the Federal Reserve banks issues the currency, and a network of banks handle the transactions. The Benjamin Franklin 100 is not backed by gold, but by its power to purchase goods or services in the economy.46 By contrast, the Monopoly money has value in the game, but nowhere else. Law is the tool that government uses to regulate, and thus legitimate, a fiat currency. As one commenter noted, vaults filled with gold have been 39. Lawful money in this context referred to gold.
