Fall 2018 Myth of the Trustless Transaction 33 generally did not accept this claim, and Bitcoin Cash trades for a fraction of the value of Bitcoin. The saga did not end there. Bitcoin still had its own consensus protocol changes to implement. The first part of the New York Agreement went off as planned, and SegWit was adopted. However, Bitcoins core development team still opposed doubling the block size.222 Signatories to the New York Agreement began reneging on their support for the increased block size.223 In November 2017, the block size increase known as SegWit2x was sus pended for lack of support.224 Outraged commenters lamented, apparently without irony, that withdrawing ones support from important agreements erodes trust within the community.225 1. Lessons from The DAO Smart Contract The core reason that Nakamoto declared Bitcoin to be a trustless system was that encryption could replace trust. He argued that with strong encryp tion, data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.226 For Nakamoto, cryptocurrency meant that without the need to trust a third party middleman money can be secure and transactions effortless. 227 However, the halo of security extends well beyond the block chain itself, inducing participants to trust a host of third parties who act as middlemen. Participants in cryptocurrency find themselves trusting ex changes, wallets, and smart contracts, all under the halo of the blockchains immutability. Under the Statute of Frauds, any contract for the sale of land, or that cannot be fully performed within one year, must be reduced to a writing. As per the Uniform Commercial Code, contracts that involve the sale of goods for more than 500 must similarly be memorialized in writing.228 Thus, alt hough oral contracts can be enforceable, most contracts are written down on David Dinkins, Bitcoin Developers Remain Adamant in Opposition to SegWit2x, 2017, 222.
