The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent that such failure shall have actually and materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party disputes its indemnification obligation for any Losses with respect to such claim, the parties shall proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of jurisdiction determined pursuant to Section 10.8. 91 Section 9.4 Limitation of Liability. a An Indemnified Party shall not be entitled to recover damages or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in respect of any one Loss. b Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no Indemnified Party shall have any right to indemnification hereunder with respect to any Loss or alleged Loss to the extent such Loss or alleged Loss is taken into account in the calculation of Closing Cash, Closing Indebtedness, Net Working Capital or Transaction Expenses, in each case, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.7. c In no event shall Parents total liability under Section 9.2ai and Section 9.2aii or Buyers total liability under Section 9.2bi or Section 9.2bii, respectively, exceed the Final Purchase Price as determined in accordance with Section 2.7. d The amount of any Losses of any Indemnified Party under this Article IX shall be calculated net of any amount actually received by an Indemnified Party from any third Person, including any insurance company or other insurance provider in each case, calculated net of any actual collection costs and reserves, expenses, deductibles or premium adjustments or retrospectively rated premiums incurred or paid to procure such recoveries in respect of any Losses suffered, paid, sustained or incurred by such Indemnified Party such net amount being referred to herein as a Third Party Reimbursement in respect of the Losses suffered thereby. If, after receipt by an Indemnified Party of an indemnification payment hereunder, such Person receives a Third Party Reimbursement in respect of the same Losses whether in whole or in part for which such indemnification payment was made, such Third Party Reimbursement was not taken into account in assessing the amount of indemnification and such Third Party Reimbursement together with such indemnification payment exceeds the amount of such Losses, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly turn over to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the lesser of i the amount of such excess and ii the amount of such previous indemnification payment.
