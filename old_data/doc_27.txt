At least one Block Withhold ing attack has been documented,186 and scholars assert that the only defense against this attack is for mining pool managers to work with miners they know personally and trust.187 Fork after Withholding attacks have been de scribed by scholars as always profitable and difficult to guard against.188 Selfish Mining had traditionally been considered impractical because it was assumed that it required control of a majority of the network nodes. Howev 183. Sybil attacks involve copying nodes to give the appearance that there are many dif ferent nodes verifying a transaction, when in fact all those pseudoparticipants are really con trolled by the same actor. Light wallets are particularly vulnerable to Sybil attacks.

Both Block Withholding and selfish mining involve withholding work. A selfish mining attack involves not immediately releasing a block but instead withholding it in an at tempt to find a second or third block for the new, secret chain. If the miner does find a second block before the network has found the first, then it can work even farther ahead while the rest of the network pursues the wrong fork. As soon as a new block is found, the withholding min er can release its blocks. As the longer chain, the newly released blocks would immediately become the most valid chain. A miner can use withholding to doublespend or to undermine the validity of a mining pools payment algorithm. See Eyal Sirer, supra note 87 describ ing a selfish mining attack but see Nicholas T.

A fork after withholding combines a block withholding attack with a selfish mining attack.

The Block Withholding Attack occurred in the Eligius mining pool and reportedly cost the pool 300 Bitcoin.

The pools response was to assure mining pool participants that any changes to the payment algorithms required the signatures of both Eligius pool founders, plus a disinterested third party. This announcement sought to leverage trust in the Eligius pool founders into trust in the validity of the mining pool payment algorithm. 187. 188. Courtois Bahack, supra note 184, at IXA.

Although this paper modeled the Fork After Withhold ing attack in bitcoin, the authors assert that other cryptocurrencies including Ethereum and Litecoin are also vulnerable.
