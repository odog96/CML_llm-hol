Trusting the Blockchain Itself The combination of difficulty in replacing a block and the distributed copies of the chain are what prompt claims about the immutability139 and re liability of the blockchain. However, this scenario also gives rise to a major limiting factor the blockchains current inability to scale.140 Each full node has an individual copy of the entire blockchain. That means that the block chain as a whole is limited by the processing capacity of each single node. As the blockchain grows, the power needed to run a full node increases dramatically and it can take many hours to process a blockchain transaction. Under ordinary circumstances, confirmation takes 12 hours.141 However, as traffic increases, processing times follow suit. For example, at the height of the December 2017 bitcoin frenzy, processing times rose from an average of 78 minutes to 1188 minutes nearly 20 hours!.142 As processing time shot up, fees increased as well. At the peak, average transaction fees topped 55 136. For a description of market manipulation, see J.P.
