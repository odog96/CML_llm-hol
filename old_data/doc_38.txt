All the Cryptokitties exist in one Ethereum smart contract.263 As one commenter points out, as far as Ethereum is concerned there is only a single version of the KittyOwnership contract, and that contract is owned by a single wallet. It doesnt get more centralized than this. 264 Indeed, the developers themselves acknowledged that their decentralized app had multiple centralized aspects.265 This struc ture has practical implications that directly contradict the marketing lan guage behind Cryptokitties. The contract holder retains near total control over the fate of the kittens. Should it choose to, the contract holder could 258. 259.
