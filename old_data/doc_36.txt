A Yes, judging by precedent.240 Hard Fork opponents pointed out that altering the blockchain is a slip pery slope241 and once the blockchain is modified in this fashion, there will inevitably be further calls for other modifications.242 More fundamentally, they argued that a hard fork to reverse this hack would violate the basic principle that code is law.243 Proponents of the hard fork retorted that the code is law approach lacks nuance and ignores the dynamic nature of law.244 Instead, they offered a vision of decisionmaking in which human beings get to think and make choices that amount to a social consensus.245 Ultimately, the hard fork was put up for a vote. A supermajority of Ether holders approved the proposal, and the hard fork took place on July 20, 2016.246 The hard fork created a new Ethereum chain. The first block on the new Ethereum chain deposited the funds lost from The DAO into an ac count available to The DAOs original investors.247 However, a sizeable mi nority of users rejected the new chain, giving rise to two Ethereum chains Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Note the ironic role that trust plays in this dramathe immutable blockchain was altered in the name of reinstating trust in the blockchain af ter a smart contract developer failed to live up to the trust placed in it. This decision unquestionably highlights the fragility of the muchtouted immuta bility of the blockchain. It is demonstrably not accurate to say that a block chain transaction cannot be reversedan assertion that is the cornerstone for the notion that the blockchain can replace trust.248 The DAO incident 240. derrend, Comment to Code is Law, REDDIT Sept. 5, 2016, 745 PM, httpswww.reddit.comrethereumcomments51bca4codeislawbottomcomments. 241.

Fall 2018 Myth of the Trustless Transaction 37 demonstrates that the blockchain is only as immutable as its community of users decides it is. That means that trusting that immutability is really trust ing the community to make the right choice. If it happened once, it could happen again, including for far less savory reasons.
