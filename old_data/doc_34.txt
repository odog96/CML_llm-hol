The main attraction of these smart contracts is the claim that using a blockchain makes the deal immutable. The code is the contract. Neither party can renege thanks to the remorseless logic crunching of the machine, whose algorithm would execute, verify, and en force itself. 229 This immutability is pitched as a means of replacing trust.230 Because the execution of the agreement is no longer separate from the agreement itself, the idea is that trust becomes unnecessary. The touted ad vantage of these trustless, selfexecuting contracts is that they can reduce or eliminate the uncertainty and transactions costs associated with executing andor enforcing a contract. Yet, smart contracts also offer a good example of how participants can confuse their decision to trust the blockchain with trusting operations that use the blockchain. In particular, the saga of an Ethereum smart contract known as The DAO231 shows how smart contracts can fail disastrously, with consequences that undermine the integrity of the blockchain itself. In 2016, an Ethereum startup called Slock.it created The DAOa smart con tract that was pitched as a distributed venture capital firm. It was intended to pool contributor money, and then distribute that money to projects the con tributors voted to fund. On a nowdeleted homepage, The DAO grandiosely proclaimed that it would blaze a new path in business organization . . . op erating solely with the steadfast iron will of unstoppable code.232 The DAO launched a twomonth investment window on April 30, 2016. By the end of May 2016, the DAO had collected roughly 12 million Ether 150 million at the time from investors.233 In early June, commenters began pointing out serious vulnerabilities in The DAOs code.234 In response, on June 12, 2016, Slock.it founder Stephan 229.

Id. pointing out that this claim about smart contracts is particularly ironic because contracts are themselves a tool for building trust. 231. Distributed Autonomous Organizations DAOs is a term that describes smart con tracts, generally. However, The DAO was a specific smart contract on Ethereum. Other DAOs exist. See e.g., DIGIX, httpsdigix.global last visited Oct. 20, 2018 Digix Global, a company that tokenizes gold on the Ethereum network, runs a DAO called DigixDAO that issues DGD tokens. Similarly, the cryptocurrency Dash is a DAO. 232. THE DAO, httpweb.archive.orgweb20160622212302httpsdaohub.org last visited Oct. 31, 2018. 233.
