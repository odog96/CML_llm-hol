Indeed, Ethereum Hard Fork opponents were prescient in their assertion that The DAO hard fork would encourage others to request similar treat ment. After a hacker exploited a vulnerability in wallets run by the company Parity, the company sought a hard fork to undo the hack.249 The hacker took control of 587 wallets holding 513,774.16 Ether worth roughly 300 mil lion at the time.250 The user then destroyed the wallets, effectively freezing those coins.251 Parity developers have requested another Ethereum hard fork to recover at least some of these coins.252 The decision of whether or not to accede to this request roiled the Ethereum network.253 It turns out that stuck, nonrecoverable Ether is a rela tively common problem.254 User error in the command line, software bugs,255 and intentional hacks like the one at Parity have all created millions of dol lars worth of stuck Ether, inaccessible to its owners.256 Commenters have pointed out that having those coins taken out of circulation increases the value of the remaining Ethercreating a clear conflict of interest between those whose Ether is not locked and the unfortunate victims of the Parity hack or other stuck situations.257 249.

The Unrealized Vulnerabilities of Cryptokitties The recent craze over Cryptokitties highlights another mistake of con flating the blockchain with smart contracts that use the blockchain. Cryp tokitties are socalled nonfungible tokens. Each Cryptokitty is cartoonlike digital cat. 258 Users use Ether to purchase tokens that give them ownership of the virtual cats, each of which has a unique identity logged on the Ethereum blockchain. In late 2017, demand for these kitties nearly broke the Ethereum network.259 At least one purchaser offered over 110,000 for a kit ten, though most sell for far less.260 The value proposition for these kittens as collectables rests on the immutable nature of the Ethereum blockchain.
