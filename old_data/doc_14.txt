ACM, July 2018, at 95. 14 Michigan Technology Law Review Vol. 251 pools, which share hash power in exchange for a portion of the reward for a successfully mined block. As a result of the distributed, and allegedly immutable nature of the blockchain, users purportedly need trust no one when using it.88 Indeed, cryptocurrency advocates have taken to heart the observation that Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carters National Security Advisor, reputedly made when asked before the 1985 arms talks in Geneva whether it made sense to trust the Russians. He replied that the point was not to trust them but to find an agreement that is selfreinforcing.89 The blockchain, and the eco system built around it, purports to provide that selfreinforcing legitimacy. Supporters make sweeping claims for the blockchain, suggesting that the technology will have massive and cascading implications to the fundamen tals of contract, public records of transaction, securities regulation and digi tal identity. 90 A.

Indeed, the essay by Satoshi Nakamoto bemoaned, The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. See Nakamoto, supra note 51. 93.
