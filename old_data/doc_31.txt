Fall 2018 Myth of the Trustless Transaction 31 blockchain from 1 MB to 2 MB.207 Others advocated a more permanent so lution in the form of a code called Segregated Witness SegWit.208 This code separated the signatures from the transaction data in each block, then only counted the transaction data as subject to the 1 MB cap. The debate over which solution to adopt raged on while the Bitcoin network got slower and slower. Finally a group of over 50 high profile companies met to resolve the situation, producing a compromise known as the New York Agreement.209 This agreement resolved the debate by agree ing to do both proposalsto increase speed by segregating transaction sig natures, and to subsequently increase in block size.210 The companies sign ing the agreement represented 83.25 of the computing power on the bitcoin blockchain.211 It should have been simple. As designed by Nakamoro, the miners de cide which code changes to accept. However, an entire economic ecosystem had grown up around the blockchain, and that ecosystem was not happy. Companies that provided cryptocurrency storage wallets aligned with the trading platforms to argue that the change should not proceed without sup port from an economic majority of the blockchains users.212 They offered an alternative proposal called BIP148, a user activated soft fork to comply with SegWit. This proposal would put blockchain users, rather than miners in the drivers seat. The stated goal was to avoid forcing users to upgrade their software unnecessarily.213 But, what was really happening was a power struggle over who gets to make choices for the blockchainthe miners or the users. For example, the users proposed that users that decide to en force the new rules will only follow blocks that conform to the existing rules which will in turn cause miners to activate SegWit.214 Their position was that the economic majority should signal support for the change, and the miners should follow along.215 The threat was that if miners did not fol low along with the user proposal, users would not recognize their coins as 207.

This plan would increase processing speed by segregating transaction signatures called witnesses, hence the name Segwit from the blockchain.
