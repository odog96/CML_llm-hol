In 2016 alone, global credit card issuers Visa, Mastercard, American Express, DinersClubDiscover and JCB handled purchases valued at 20.60 trillion.73 The credit card companies serve as the trusted ledgerkeeper to log these transactions. Their role is critical for ensuring that individuals do not doublespend digital credits by copying the information and sending it to two creditors at once, or by sending the copy to a creditor while retaining the original to use again in another transaction.74 By virtue of this role, the ledger keepers are privy to sensitive infor mation about anyone using a credit card, a bank transfer, or a mobile pay ment system. This information, along with their gatekeeping function gives these companies tremendous power over consumers and allows them to dominate key points of the digital economy. Recently, a series of high pro file hacks have soured the public on many formerlytrusted intermediaries.75 Companies ranging from LinkedIn, to Target, to Experian have all reported massive data breaches that revealed private information from millions of people.76 There is a growing perception that traditional data management practices have created an architecture of vulnerability that does not suffi 71.

The role of the trusted intermediary, like Visa or Mastercard, is to keep track of the digital credits exchanged across multiple transactions in order to prevent this kind of double spending. Physical money by and large does not share this problem. The parties to a transac tion physically transfer the asset between themselves. While counterfeiting remains a possibil ity, it is difficult to replicate physical currency, and the parties can verify the bona fides of the currency before or immediately after the exchange.
