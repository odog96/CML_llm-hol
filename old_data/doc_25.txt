After all, they have been repeatedly assured that the blockchain replaces trust. 2. The Blockchains Integrity Depends on the Honesty of Miners Blockchains rely heavily on economic games that are intended to incen tivize actors to cooperate. When the games work, the integrity of the block chain is maintained. However, from the genesis block onward, it has been clear that the blockchain is secure only so long as honest miners control more computational power than a group of cooperating attackers.168 The main caveat to the blockchains probabilistic guarantee of validity is that it assumes no single miner controls a majority of the network. If a single min er or pool of miners were to control 51 of the nodes, a socalled 51 at tack the system would cease to be decentralized. At that point, the majority miner could unilaterally control which blocks are added to the blockchain, enabling himher to doublespend at will. Of course, theoretical vulnerabil ity is not the same as an actual threat in the real world.169 From time to time, scholars float the concern that a government might engage in a 51 attack in order to destroy the Bitcoin economy in order to achieve utility outside the Bitcoin economy.170 The possibility of a 51 attack used to be considered more theoretical than actual, even though in 2016 there was a 51 attack against a smaller Ethereum chain.171 Then, in the summer of 2018, at least five cryptocurren cies were subject to 51 attacks within the space of a single month.172 The compromised currencies included Zencash, Monacoin, Bitcoin gold, Verge and Litecoin.173 There is even a website projecting the cost of acquiring the 167. 168. 169.

For example, while it is theoretically possible to crack the encryption at the core of the blockchain, that risk is so improbable that it can safely be dismissed.
