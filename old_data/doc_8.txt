See e.g., Stephanie Bell, The Role of the State and the Hierarchy of Money, 25 CAMBRIDGE J. ECON. 149, 15357 2001. 8 Michigan Technology Law Review Vol. 251 replaced by law and trust.47 There is no question that trust in the law is an indispensable attribute of modern monetary systems. For example, a busi ness willing to accept a check as payment for service does so in the context of fraud protection in the banking system, and the law of negotiable instru ments. This remains true even though it is highly likely that the business representative does not consciously consider the soundness of the banking system or the Uniform Commercial Code when making this decision. Thus, an invisible edifice of law generates the trust that makes the individual transaction possible.48 Without trust in the banking system, such transactions become extremely risky. The Federal Reserve Banks are tasked with main taining the stability of the money supply in order to cultivate this trust. Without trust in the legitimacy of a currency as a holder of value and a medium of exchange, a states social institutions can disintegrate.49 Indeed, collapse of trust in the monetary system is generally considered a sign of a social system under severe strain. 50 This was the situation after Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG imploded, and other major too big to fail banks needed a federal bailout. During the depth of the resulting financial crisis, Satoshi Nokamoto wrote the Bitcoin White Paper.51 He asserted that the root problem with conventional currency is all the trust thats required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.52 Echoing this lament, cryptocurrency supporters like to claim that the problem with regular fiat currency is that governments can print as much of it as they like, and they frequently do.53 Unlike fiat currency, Nokamotos Bitcoin is finitethe Bitcoin protocol was designed so that only 21 million Bitcoins can ever be 47.
