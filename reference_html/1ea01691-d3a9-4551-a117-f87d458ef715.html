            <p>The net effect of this situation i.e., case law and the AMD settlement is that while it is possible for competitors to imitate the functionality of Intel processors, future imitations are not expected to be as close an imitation as were the Am386 and Am486 products from AMD. Competitors products may add features and increase performance. The Company also faces significant competition from companies that offer rival microprocessor architectures. The Company cannot predict whether such rival architectures will gain market acceptance or provide increased competition to the Companys products. Future distortion of price maturity curves could occur as imitation products enter the market in significant volume or alternative architectures gain market acceptance. It continues to be Intels strategy to maintain its competitive advantage through aggressive investments in manufacturing capacity and the development and marketing of advanced products which provide greater functionality to its customers than is provided by competitive products. Intel also is committed to the protection of its intellectual property rights against illegal use. There can be no assurance, however, that competitors will not introduce new products either imitative or of rival architectural designs or reduce prices on existing products. Such developments could have an adverse effect on Intels revenues and margins. Other brands and names are the property of their respective owners PAGE 7 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Companys competitive position has developed to a large extent because of its emphasis upon research and development. This emphasis has enabled Intel to deliver products before they have become available from competitors, and thus has permitted Intels customers to commit to the use of these new products in the development of their own products. Intels research and development activities are directed toward developing new products, hardware technologies and processes and improving existing products and lowering their cost. The Company also develops enabling software, such as open software specifications and software tools, to enhance the functionality and acceptance of the personal computer platform Intels expenditures for research and development were 1,111 million, 970 million and 780 million in fiscal years 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively. As of December 31, 1994, Intel had approximately 6,400 employees engaged in research and development. The results of Intels research and development activities depend upon competitive circumstances and Intels ability to transfer new products to production in a timely and costeffective manner. Most design and development of VLSI components and other products is performed at Intels facilities in Santa Clara and Folsom, California Aloha and Hillsboro, Oregon Chandler, Arizona and Haifa, Israel. In June 1994, Intel and HewlettPackard Company announced a joint research and development project covering a wide range of activities, including semiconductor processes, software optimization and microprocessor design technologies. New 64bit processors based on the jointly developed architecture are expected to be initially targeted at server, workstation and enterprise computing products, probably in the late 1990s. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND LICENSING Intellectual property rights which apply to various Intel products include patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and maskwork rights.</p>
